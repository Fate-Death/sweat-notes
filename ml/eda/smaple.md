Got it — if you want to **predict Calories\_Burned** for high accuracy but you **don’t have BPM**, you can still achieve strong performance by rethinking the features and compensating for the missing heart rate data.

---

## **1. Replace BPM with Derived or Proxy Features**

Since BPM is a measure of intensity, you can use **other features** that correlate with it:

* **Workout\_Type** → HIIT will generally burn more calories than Yoga for the same duration.
* **Session\_Duration** → direct correlation with calories burned.
* **Body weight / fat percentage / BMI** → determines base energy expenditure.
* **Age & Gender** → affect BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate).
* **Experience\_Level** → may influence efficiency and intensity.

---

## **2. Feature Engineering Without BPM**

You can still create features that capture *intensity* indirectly:

* **Estimated MET value**: Assign a standard **Metabolic Equivalent of Task** per workout type (e.g., Yoga = 3, Strength = 6, HIIT = 9).
  This is public data from exercise physiology tables.
* **BMR calculation** (Harris–Benedict formula):
  For example, for men:

  $$
  BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 \times \text{Weight in kg}) + (4.799 \times \text{Height in cm}) - (5.677 \times \text{Age})
  $$

  For women, the formula is slightly different.
* **Calories ≈ MET × weight(kg) × duration(hours)** → This gives you a very strong baseline that the ML model can refine.

---

## **3. Data Preprocessing**

1. **One-hot encode** Workout\_Type and Gender.
2. Normalize continuous features (optional for trees, required for linear models/NNs).
3. Remove obvious outliers (e.g., 3000 calories for 0.5 hr yoga).

---

## **4. Model Choice**

Since the relationship is non-linear, start with:

* **RandomForestRegressor** (baseline, robust)
* **XGBoost / LightGBM** (often better performance)
* Optionally: **Linear Regression** to benchmark

---

## **5. Training Flow**

1. Train/test split.
2. Evaluate with **R²** and **MAE**.
3. Tune hyperparameters (number of trees, depth, learning rate).
4. Use feature importance to see what’s driving calorie predictions.

---

## **6. Deployment in Your Tracker**

When a user logs:

* Age, Gender, Weight, Height, Fat%, Session Duration, Workout\_Type
* Model predicts calories burned.
* You can feed this prediction back into your personalization logic (e.g., suggest increasing intensity if calorie burn goal is not met).

---

If you want, I can **design the full feature set and preprocessing pipeline** so you can train this high-accuracy calories-burned model even without BPM, and still get a performance close to the BPM version. That would include the MET-based proxy intensity values.
